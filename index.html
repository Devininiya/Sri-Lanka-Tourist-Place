  <p id="tder" >Sri Lanka (Sinhala ශ්‍රී ලංකා, śrī laṃkā, [ˌɕriːˈlaŋkaː]; Tamil இலங்கை, ilaṅkai), from 1796 to 1972 Ceylon, is an island state in the Indian Ocean, 237 km (west coast of the island) east of the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent, and had about 22 million inhabitants in 2021. The shortest distance between India (Kodiyakkarai) and Sri Lanka (Munasal) is 54.8 km.

  The island was a strategic hub for sea travel between the Middle East and Southeast Asia from ancient to modern times. The south and the areas around Anuradhapura were centers of ancient Buddhism; in the north and east there were Hindu temple complexes.[7] Sri Lanka is today a multi-religious and multi-ethnic nation in which Christianity and Islam are important religions alongside Buddhism and Hinduism. The Sinhalese make up the majority of the population. The Tamils are the largest minority. Other ethnic minorities are the Moors, Malays, Burghers and the indigenous population of Sri Lanka, the Veddas.</p>

        <p id="tder">Jaffna Public Library (Tamil: யாழ் பொது நூலகம்; Sinhala: යාපනය මහජන පුස්තකාලය) is located in Jaffna, Sri Lanka. It is one of Jaffna's most notable landmarks, and is run by the Jaffna Municipal Council. The library was built in 1933 and burnt in 1981. During the early 1980s, it was one of the biggest libraries in Asia, containing over 97,000 books and manuscripts.[2][3] Over a million books burned in the 1981 arson attack. Some ancient Sinhala and Tamil books were never recovered. In 2001, rehabilitation of the library was completed, with new structures being built and new books received, although its old books and manuscripts were not replaced. It is Sri Lanka's second main public Library, only rivalled by Colombo Public Library[4]

        The building's classical lines and beautiful proportions make it stand out architecturally. It contains lush gardens and has been modernized with new facilities such as free-wifi that was added in 2016
        The burning of the Jaffna Public Library (Tamil: யாழ் பொது நூலகம் எரிப்பு, Yāḻ potu nūlakam erippu; Sinhala: යාපනය මහජන පුස්තකාලය ගිනිබත් කිරීම, Yāpanaya mahajana pustakālaya ginibat kirīma) took place on the night of June 1, 1981, when an organized mob of Sinhalese individuals went on a rampage, burning the library.[1] It was one of the most violent examples of ethnic biblioclasm of the 20th century.[Term][3] At the time of its destruction, the library was one of the biggest in Asia, containing over 97,000 books and manuscripts.[4][5]

        The priest and scholar Rev. Fr. (Dr.) H. S. David died of shock the next day after seeing flames engulfing Jaffna Library from his room at St. Patrick's College, Jaffna the night before.</p>
